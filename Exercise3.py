    """
    Defined dictionary, added my name, age and hometown, aswell as defined those
    being "ythan", 18 and "sharjah"
    I learned that a for loop is more effecient to use than repeatedly using a print line
    in this case it explains if a key, which is the first variable in the dictionary, and a certain
    value in the dictionary, are inside the dictionary, it will print all three lines
