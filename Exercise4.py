        I made a string input wherein we were tasked to input the question, followed by an if statement
        the if statement explains if the user inputs the answer "paris"
        the question would reply "nice one", but if it was anything else, it would print out
        "wrong!" suggesting and giving feedback that the user has made an invalid answer.
